## Overview
This analysis was created as a pitch to potential investors for bringing the concept of NYC CitiBike company to Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis pulls data from the NYC venture to create visualizations of the schematics of the company. These visulaizations cover data such as usage by gender, checkout times, trip duration, bike station locations, etc. The idea is to then take the information learned from said data and in turn apply it to the creation of a similar company in Des Moines.
