## Overview
This analysis was created as a pitch to potential investors for bringing the concept of NYC CitiBike company to Des Moines, Iowa. The analysis pulls data from the NYC venture to create visualizations of the schematics of the company. These visulaizations cover data such as usage by gender, checkout times, trip duration, bike station locations, etc. The idea is to then take the information learned from said data and in turn apply it to the creation of a similar company in Des Moines.

## Results

### 1. Gender Breakdown

The majority of users are male. Reasons for this are unknown, it may be due to bike sizes, bike seat sizes, or some other unkown factor.


### 2. User Trips by Gender by Weekday

Male subscribers are the biggest users, with their most active days being on Thursdays. One time customers for all genders are the most active on Saturdays and Sundays.

Males dominate bike usage, with most journeys for all genders being between 5 - 35 minutes. Given NYC notorious terrible traffic and complicated subway system, it may be that subscribers and customers are using the bikes as means of transportation around the city. 



### 5. Top Bike Stations in the City for Starting a Journey

The majority of bike usage comes from the southwest and central parts of Manhatten, especially near the Empire State Building. This indicates that tourists might makes up the majority of CitiBike's customer base. 


## Summary


From the data gathered it appears that males in majority tourist areas using the bikes for 5 - 35 mintues at a time make up the majority of the clientelle for CitiBikes. Before using this information to structure the framework for the business model in Des Moines, there are a few things to consider. 

1. NYC is not very car friendly, so alternative means of transportation such as bikes, subways, and walking are far more normalized there than in other parts of the United States. 
2. NYC is a very tourist heavy place, and juding by the data the majority of CitiBike's clients are tourists. It is unlikely that Des Moines has as many toursits visting, which could affect the viability of opening up a bike share business there. 
3. Riding Bikes in NYC is very normalized; as such, there is infrustruture put in place to make the city bike friendly. Additionally, while NYC itself is very large, there are multiple ecosystems of stores contained within blocks of each other throughout the city such as restarounts, grocery stores, retail stores, hotel, muesums, etc., so users never have to bike far to find what they're looking. The same cannot be said for Des Moines. If clients were to use the bikes, it would most likely be for liesure, excersise, or to get around downtown areas. 

Given all of this information, there needs to be further research done within Des Moines itself to see if bringing a bike share company to the city is viable. 

### Further Analysis Reccomendations 

Before bringing this idea to investors, I reccomend that a few data gathering projects within the city of Des Moines, Iowa are done first. This data should look at things like how bikeable is the city? what is the public interest in using bikes in a car dominated area? where would these bike stations be located (i.e. would they have to stay downtown, or could they go across the whole city, even crossing highways)? what is the public sentiament towards bike sharing services in Des Moines?

Questions like these should be answered and visualized before brining this idea to investors. If we were bringing a bike sharing company to an equitable city to NYC such as Chicago, LA, Miami, then it might be more viable. But it is my strong reccomendation that the above data is gathered before trying to involve investors.
